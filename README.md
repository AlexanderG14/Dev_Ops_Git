As with any computer science student I'm naturally interested with how things currently stand within the software industry and what current trends are. From this article, it seems if you want to be a software engineer anywhere in the world, united states is probably the best bet in regards to the salary you earn on average. Despite the hype of how China is pouring massive amounts of resources into their technological infrastructure, the average pay is still lagging way behind compared to other developed countries. 

More importantly, job satisfaction within the industry riduculously high with most developers participating in the stackoverflow survey rating their satisfaction as 'slightly satisfied' or 'very satisfied'. I guess the money probably plays a part too. Next, software engineering is still a young field, and I mean literally young. Most people who are getting into it are still in their 20s and 30s. I mean if I were to work for a firm I'd like to be around workers my age, no disrespect to older people, just more to talk about. To be honest, I didn't really expect such a big majority to be so young. I mean I thought there'd be a larger hump around the 40s range since we did go through the dot-com boom and bust. Still interesting.

This was an interesting article with useful information for anyone going into the Software Development field. I really appreciate that the piece showed that a lot of developers work remote.  I personally like the idea of being able to work remotely.  Edit by: Alexander.
